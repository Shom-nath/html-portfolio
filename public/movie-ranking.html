    <h1>Best movies according to Shom</h1>
    <h2>My top 3 movies of all-time</h2>
    <hr />
    <h3>Pother Panchali</h3>
    <p>One of the masterpieces of Satyajit Ray, this movie takes us to the land of innocence of our forgotton childhoods, unblemished by modern society, where the sound of approaching train as seen from the midst of paddy field stirs pure joy and happiness</p>
    <h3>Gupi Gayen Bagha Bayen</h3>
    <p>Ray transports us to the fantasy land of Gupi and Bagha, who acquired special powers by their musical acumen, pleasing the King of the Spirits. Thru the film he deliver several undetones - moral, political, righteous - all maintaing the light humour of the film</p>
    <h3>Dilwale Dulhaniya Le Jayenge</h3>
    <p>Perhaps no other film embodies more the modern Indian values and tradition than that portrayed to near perfection as in this film. It depicts the eternal conflict between tradition and modernism.The movie has it all in terms of pure entertainment from story-line to songs to acting performances from Shahrukh Khan and Kajol.Even after several decades it is not uncommon to hear the songs of the film being played in streets of India, speaking aloud of its immense popularity even today.</p>
